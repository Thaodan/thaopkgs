- Information file for 'pastebincl' by Th√©ophile BASTIAN (aka Tobast) -

So, you've downloaded the source code of PastebinCL and don't know how to compile it?
Follow those steps!


----------------
BEFORE COMPILING
----------------

- Go to the "src" directory
- You'll maybe have a file named "data_devcode_default.h" and no "data_devcode.h". Then rename it to "data_devcode.h".
- Get your Pastebin Developper API Key on this page : http://pastebin.com/api (you must register to http://pastebin.com, it's free).
- Open "data_devcode.h", and define "DEVELOPPER_CODE" to your Developper API Key by adding it between the quotes, eg.
	#define DEVELOPPER_CODE "[my_api_key_here]"
- Save and close "data_devcode.h"
- Open "data.h" and select your OS by commenting the wrong one (add "//" at the beginning of the line) and uncommenting the other, eg.
	If you're using Windows:
		// #define UNIX
		#define WINDOWS

	If you're using UNIX (Linux, MacOS, BSD, ...):
		#define UNIX
		// #define WINDOWS
	
	(around the line 40, you'll find this code)
- Save and close "data.h"
- You're ready to compile!


------------------------
COMPILE ON UNIX-BASED OS
------------------------

- Just run "make" and then "make install" (as root for installing) ;)


------------------
COMPILE ON WINDOWS
------------------

- If you can run "make" using CygWIN, MinGW or other, that's the easiest way.
- Else, you can create a Code::blocks or other IDE project and then compile.

(But, really, I cannot see why you want to use a command-line tool on Windows.)
